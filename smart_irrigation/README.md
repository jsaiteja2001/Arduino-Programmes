# Smart Irrigation System

## Overview
The Smart Irrigation System is an Arduino-based project that automates the watering process for plants. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture, water levels, and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) to optimize irrigation and conserve water. The system is equipped with an LCD for real-time data display, LEDs for visual feedback, and a relay-controlled pump for efficient irrigation.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Irrigation**:
  - Activates or deactivates the pump based on soil moisture levels.
- **Water Level Detection**:
  - Monitors the water tank to ensure the pump doesnâ€™t run dry.
- **Environmental Monitoring**:
  - Tracks temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor.
- **Real-Time Display**:
  - LCD shows soil moisture, water pump status, temperature, and humidity.
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - LEDs to indicate dry or moist soil.
- **Serial Monitor Logging**:
  - Logs system activity and sensor readings for monitoring and debugging.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Mega)
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **DHT Sensor** (e.g., DHT11, DHT22)
- **Water Level Sensor**
- **12V Water Pump**
- **Relay Module** (to control the pump)
- **16x2 I2C LCD**
- **LEDs** (2x: for dry and moist soil indicators)
- **Power Supply** (for Arduino and pump)
- **Jumper Wires** and **Breadboard**

---

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**
- Required Libraries:
  - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
  - `DHT`

## How to Use
### Step 1: Setup the Circuit
- Assemble the circuit as per the connection table above.
- Ensure the relay and pump are properly connected and powered.

### Step 2: Install Libraries
1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
3. Search for and install:
   - **LiquidCrystal_I2C**
   - **DHT**

### Step 3: Upload the Code
1. Copy the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
3. Select the correct board and COM port.
4. Click **Upload** to upload the program to the Arduino.

### Step 4: Monitor and Test the System
- Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M) to view real-time logs.
- Observe the LCD for:
  - **Temperature and Humidity**
  - **Pump ON/OFF status**
- Test the system by simulating different soil and water conditions.

## Example Output
### Serial Monitor
```plaintext
Temp: 28.4C Hum: 45.0%
Soil is Dry. Pump ON.
Temp: 28.3C Hum: 46.1%
Soil is Moist. Pump OFF.
Water Tank Empty.
```

### LCD Display
```
Temp: 28C
Hum: 45%
Pump ON
```

---

## Customization
### Adjust Thresholds
- Modify the soil moisture or water level logic to fit your specific sensors and requirements:
  ```cpp
  if (soilMoisture == HIGH && waterLevel == HIGH) {
      // Custom logic here
  }
  ```

### Add Weather-Based Control
- Integrate a WiFi module (e.g., ESP8266) to fetch weather data and adjust irrigation based on rainfall predictions.

### Notifications
- Add an IoT platform (e.g., Blynk) or an SMS module to send mobile alerts for system events.

---

## Troubleshooting
### LCD Not Displaying Data
- Ensure the correct I2C address (`0x27`) is used in the code.
- Check the SDA and SCL connections.

### Pump Not Working
- Verify the relay module is connected correctly and the pump is powered.

### Incorrect Sensor Readings
- Ensure the DHT and soil moisture sensors are properly connected.
- Check the sensor specifications and replace if damaged.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Solar Power Integration**:
  - Use solar panels to make the system energy-efficient.
- **Multi-Zone Irrigation**:
  - Expand the system to monitor and irrigate multiple zones independently.
